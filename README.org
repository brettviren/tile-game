Caveat: I may update this site from time to time.  There is no attempt to do
schema evolution on the data stored in your browser's Local Storage for this
site.  Old data and a new site can be inconsistent and the only recourse is to
go to Inspect->Storage->Local Storage, select this site and delete.  When I stop
messing about, I'll remove this caveat.

Caveat: this fork is largely vibe coded.  I do look at the produced code for
sanity but there is no guarantee that this fork does not ruin all that you hold
dear.  Please do not pester the original author with any problems you may
encounter (nor me for that matter).
